## Models with nested numerical solving problems

In computational biology we often have problems with known mathematical
structure, but the maths is complicated, so we can't analytically connect
unknown parameters with measurable quantities. Sometimes it's still possible to
find the measurable quantities using numerical approximations.

Examples:

- find the steady state
- solve an initial value problem

Bayesian models with nested solving problems are tricky but doable.
