# Welcome!

This is a course about Bayesian statistics, targeted at systems biologists.

There are three intended learning outcomes:

1. Understand the theoretical basis for applying Bayesian data analysis to
practical scientific problems

2. Develop a familiarity with implementing Bayesian data analysis using modern
software tools

3. Gain deep understanding of both theory and practice of elements of Bayesian
data analysis that are particularly relevant to computational biology, including
custom hierarchical models, large analyses and statistical models with embedded
ODE systems.

## General format

Each week we have a one-hour seminar. The goal is to spend the time approximately
as follows:

1. 25-35mins on 'theory', aka learning things from the book and getting more
reading material

2. 25-35mins on practical computer work

## Plan

### Week 1: [What is Bayesian inference?](week1.md) 

#### Theory 

Statistical inference in general 

Bayesian statistical inference 

The big challenge: dimensionality 

#### Practice

### Week 3: After MCMC: diagnostics, and decisions  

#### Theory 

Diagnostics: convergence, divergent transitions, effective sample size 

Model evaluation as decision theory
